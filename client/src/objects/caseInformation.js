Abbitt had a strong alibi, stating that he was at work at the time of the crime, and although his employer testified to this alibi, he could not provide a time card due to the four-year time lapse between the crime and the trial. Based exclusively on the eyewitness identifications by the two young victims, Abbitt was convicted of rape, burglary, and kidnapping and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus an additional 110 years. We think what would benefit Joseph, would consist of legal fees, personal contact in the form of letters, familial contact in the form of email, and contacting those in law enforcment who investigated this case.",
